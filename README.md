# STOP GRAY ON WHITE!

This is a WIP Chrome Extension. I decided to create this to solve my biggest problem with the modern web: **low text contrast**, specifically grey on white background.

They say it looks good and it's easier on the eyes, but I disagree. I can't see it to say it's beautiful, and a thing I can't see cannot cause eye strains on me.

## The extension

This is my first ever Chrome extension and I wrote it in the span of 1 hour, so it's not the best code ever and it's not user-friendly at all. I hope to change this reality in the near future.

### Known issues
- Can't change the page color once it's changed once;
- Probably a lot more.

### Needed improvements to-do list

I consider the extension not usable by anyone but me while I haven't completed the following tasks:

- [ ] Allow the user to configure the substitute color to their preference;
- [ ] Toggle to persist the change for a given website;
